            <p>Hello, my name is Cody Christian and I am a Web Developer and Designer 
                located in Denver Colorado. I work to build an aesthetic and dynamic approach to
                designing web pages and applications. I have a background in fine art and experience working with
                coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and frameworks such as React.js.
                I have worked one on one with artists and designers to design their websites from clean slate to full deployment.
